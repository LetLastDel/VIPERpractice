## About project:
A two-page project designed for practical exploration of the VIPER architecture without using Storyboard. 
It operates asynchronously with a network API to fetch a list of movies. JSON data is transformed into Entity objects, from which only the necessary data is extracted and stored in the Model layer. 
Subsequently, this data is presented on the View layer. The first page consists of a table displaying movies, and upon tapping a table cell, the second View is presented, displaying detailed information about the selected movie.
